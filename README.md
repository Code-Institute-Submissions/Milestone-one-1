# Milestone One 

This is the first of five Milestones for the Code Institute Full Stack Developer Course. I decided to make a homepage for an artist with the purpose of showcasing their music by providing examples, allowing to be contacted for projects and all in all introducing themselves to an existing and potential audience

The website is aimed at the arists fanbase which are not tech-savvy and need clear structures with easily accessible information. They are less likely to access the website via mobile than via Desktop PC, but I tried to pay particular attention to mobile loading times. 

I created wireframes in Balsamiq, a link can be found here --> https://balsamiq.cloud/s74acfz/p7k2tvx

### Key Features


1) Music
    - implemented youtube video and mp3 files to showcase the artists work (placeholder content mentioned below)
3) Events 
    - A selection of past and future events 


Features Left to Implement

The search bar is currently not functional and the contact form itself cannot be used yet. I am planning to implement those as soon as I have completed the necessary stage of the course
